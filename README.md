# Let's Chat

Let's Chat is a video chat application primarily designed for informal meetings among colleagues and friends. It is built using Next.js for the frontend, styled with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components, and integrates Stream.io for real-time video calling. User authentication is handled via Clerk.

## Getting Started

To run the project locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/suvigyagarg/Lets-chat.git
cd Lets-chat
npm install
npm run dev
```



## What's Next
This project is no longer under active development as I have decided to shift focus to other projects that align better with my interests ,for the time being. Although Let's Chat is fully functional and supports creating and joining video meeting rooms with features of a basic video conferencing tools, I found the concept less engaging over time. Instead, I am now working on two new projects: a terminal-based chat client and a CLI-based ToDo application. Both are available on my GitHub and reflect my current direction in building more technically challenging and personally interesting tools.
